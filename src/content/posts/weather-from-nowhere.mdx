# conditions for the hours between hours

current readings from station 44-omega suggest pressure systems that shouldn't coexist. barometric measurements oscillating between 29.82 and 31.15 within the same breath. meteorologists claim instrument failure. instruments claim meteorologist failure.

temperature holds at 67 degrees and falling upward.

## precipitation: uncertain

radar shows storms approaching from three directions that occupy the same compass point. estimated arrival time varies depending on which clock you consult. some measure hours. others measure the space between heartbeats. neither agrees on current conditions.

the rain supposedly started yesterday but won't arrive until next week. witnesses report drops falling upward through gaps in tomorrow. collection gauges read empty and overflowing simultaneously. standard protocols recommend carrying both umbrellas and sunblock for the same event.

visibility extends to the edge of understanding. beyond that: fog composed of unresolved questions.

## wind advisory

gusts from the northwest at speeds measured in sensations rather than miles per hour. the anemometer spins counterclockwise through time zones. wind chill factor calculated in memories of cold rather than actual temperature drop.

residents report breezes that smell like childhood basements. like copper. like the moment before someone tells you something that changes everything. the national weather service has no symbols for these conditions.

advisories suggest securing loose certainties. anything not firmly anchored to consensus reality may drift into adjacent timelines. several pets already reported in neighboring dimensions. authorities claim this is unrelated to atmospheric conditions.

## extended outlook

<InlineShader id="weather-3" colors={[[0.5, 0.6, 0.8], [0.7, 0.6, 0.5], [0.4, 0.5, 0.6]]} width="50%" float="right" height="270px" />

the five-day forecast shows tuesday occurring before monday. wednesday cancelled due to scheduling conflicts with itself. thursday experiences multiple instances simultaneously. friday exists only in peripheral vision.

high pressure systems moving in from regions that don't appear on standard maps. low pressure zones forming in pocket dimensions. fronts colliding in spaces between seconds. meteorological models suggest impossible weather patterns stabilizing into new configurations of impossible.

satellite imagery reveals cloud formations spelling words in languages not yet invented. or already forgotten. precipitation probability holds steady at yes and no. temperature trends indicate warmth remembering how to be cold. cold forgetting it was ever warm.

## local conditions

some neighborhoods report sunshine. others report sunshine's oppositeâ€”not darkness but the absence of the concept of light. several blocks experience weather from their own pasts. one intersection stuck in permanent autumn. another cycling through seasons that don't exist in standard calendars.

<InlineShader id="weather-4" colors={[[0.8, 0.7, 0.6], [0.6, 0.5, 0.7], [0.5, 0.6, 0.7]]} width="43%" float="left" height="240px" />

barometric pressure in basement apartments differs from rooftop measurements by impossible margins. each floor of high-rises experiences distinct microclimates. penthouse residents report weather from parallel timelines. ground floor tenants claim the sky tastes different than it looks.

## what the instruments say

station 44-omega continues broadcasting. each transmission contradicting the last. weather balloons launched yesterday still rising through tomorrow. radar returns showing storms that already happened meeting storms that refuse to occur.

the forecast calls for conditions. the conditions call for interpretation. interpretation dissolves somewhere between the satellite and your screen. between the measurement and the reading. between what is and what the instruments insist cannot be.

carry appropriate protection. or don't. the weather will do what weather does when no one's watching.

or when everyone is.

current conditions subject to retrospective change. yesterday's forecast may be updated tomorrow. time remains cloudy with a chance of itself.

station 44-omega signing off until we were already speaking.
