your hand knows where it should be. reaches without thinking. fingers curl into the space where fabric meets air meets nothing.

the phantom pocket.

## the archaeology of gesture

supposedly you wore those jeans for three years. washed them maybe seventeen times. your phone lived in that pocket. or your keys. or both, allegedly. the muscle memory carved itself deep into your nervous system like water through limestone.

now the jeans are gone. donated or dissolved or stolen by the dimension that takes single socks. but your hand. your hand still reaches.

## the cartography of absence

scientists don't study this. no grants for mapping the coordinates of what isn't there. but your neurons fire anyway. a phantom limb for clothing. the ghost of utility.

  colors={[[0.6, 0.4, 0.3], [0.8, 0.5, 0.4], [0.3, 0.2, 0.2]]}

perhaps it's the same mechanism that makes amputees feel their missing fingers. your brain constructed a body map that included that pocket. the denim became part of your proprioception. your sense of self extended four inches to the right of your hip bone.

or maybe not.

## the ritual of checking

watch someone who just switched pants. they'll reach for the phantom pocket seven, eight, twelve times before the pattern breaks. each reach a small prayer to continuity. a superstition that the pocket might materialize if you just believe hard enough.

the pocket that's not really there becomes more real than the one that is.

## what remains

your new pants have pockets. different pockets. two inches higher. deeper, allegedly. better designed, according to whoever designs such things.

but your hand keeps reaching for the ghost.

somewhere in the void between what was and what is, the phantom pocket waits. holding phantom keys. phantom receipts from phantom transactions. evidence of a life that maybe happened. or didn't.

the pocket remembers even if you forget.

or perhaps it's the other way around.
