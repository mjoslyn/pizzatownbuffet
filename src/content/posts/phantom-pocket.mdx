some pockets hold coins. some hold keys. this one holds frequencies.

the musical pocket.

## the discovery

it started with loose change. four quarters. allegedly. you walked and they jingled. not random percussion. a pattern. every third step the rhythm shifted. syncopated. like someone programmed your stride.

or the pocket programmed you.

scientists would call it sympathetic resonance. the fabric creates a chamber. the objects inside become instruments. your body heat changes the tension. every movement a conductor's gesture.

## the experiments

you tried different contents. three pennies and a guitar pick. bass notes and treble. a harmonic that shouldn't exist in copper and denim but does.

bobby pins create interference patterns. keys unlock rhythms. a folded receipt becomes a reed. the pocket doesn't discriminate. everything vibrates at its own frequency. the pocket just amplifies what was already singing.

or invents new songs from silence.

## the theory of pocket acoustics

supposedly there's a sweet spot. right hip. approximately four inches deep. where your femur acts as a resonator and your pelvis reflects sound back into the chamber. accidental architecture. evolutionary music theory written in bone and fabric.

but some pockets never sing. same jeans. same coins. dead air.

perhaps the pocket chooses its music.

## what the pocket knows

empty your musical pocket and it forgets its songs. fill it again and new compositions emerge. the pocket has no memory. only potential. a tuning fork waiting for impact.

you walk differently now. listening. adjusting your stride to hear what melody might surface from lint and copper and the friction of existence.

the pocket hums. or you imagine it does.

the distinction dissolves somewhere between your hip and your hearing.
