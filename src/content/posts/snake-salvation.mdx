# snake finds something in sixteen over eleven, maybe

the snake moved wrong. slithered through patterns that shouldn't accommodate bodies. sixteen beats divided by eleven feels like counting with too many fingers. or not enough. the snake's spine held more joints than seemed necessary. each vertebra ticking to its own subdivision. nothing synchronized. everything moving.

## what snakes know about time

snakes don't walk. no legs hitting ground in intervals that make sense to watching eyes. the whole body moves like muscle attempting escape from bone. each segment finding its moment separately. watching it long enough makes your own spine feel wrong. makes you wonder if bilateral symmetry was a mistake.

this particular snake—if it was particular, if it was only one snake—found something in 16/11 that bodies with matched limbs can't access. or it just moved and someone counted wrong and the numbers stuck.

sixteen pulses in eleven spaces. trying to fit them makes your mouth count strange syllables. your fingers tap out of phase with themselves. the pattern eats its own tail but the tail keeps growing back longer. different. the math works until you try to feel it. then something in your inner ear protests.

## the searching, or the wandering

whether the snake searched or just followed heat gradients that happen to form patterns, who can say. snakes taste air with their tongues. split tongues sampling space in dual channels. tasting time in stereo. maybe that's how it found the 16/11. maybe split perception makes asymmetric meters feel natural.

<InlineShader id="shader-coil" colors={[[0.6, 0.2, 0.8], [0.3, 0.9, 0.5], [0.9, 0.4, 0.2]]} width="45%" float="left" height="240px" />

watching someone count 16/11 out loud does something to their face. the mouth shapes wrong syllables. eyes tracking invisible beats that drift. some musicians report tasting copper. others claim their left and right hands forget they belong to the same person. the meter splits proprioception. makes you feel like you're shedding from inside.

molting happens whether the snake chooses it or not. the old skin doesn't peel away clean. it catches on things. tears. leaves pieces behind. the new skin underneath hasn't hardened yet. vulnerable. wrong. the snake during molt can't see properly. the eye caps cloud. it navigates by feeling vibrations through jaw bones pressed to ground.

maybe 16/11 feels like that. moving through patterns while blind. while your outer layer peels away in strips.

## salvation as mistimed pattern

what salvation means for something without eyelids. something that unhooks its jaw to swallow prey whole. that feels vibration through ribs. continuation, maybe. another winter survived by slowing metabolism until the heart beats once per minute. twice per minute. a rhythm so slow it seems like stopping.

or maybe salvation is when the pattern breaks badly enough that continuation becomes something else. sixteen over eleven doesn't resolve. doesn't settle. the downbeat drifts like a vertebra sliding out of alignment. still moving but moving wrong. walking after the stroke. talking with half a tongue.

<InlineShader id="shader-break" colors={[[0.9, 0.5, 0.1], [0.2, 0.6, 0.9], [0.7, 0.1, 0.7]]} width="55%" float="right" height="260px" />

the snake supposedly stopped counting. but snakes don't count. never did. just responded to patterns in ways that looked like understanding to people who count everything. the release, if it happened, happened without language. without beats marked as one. just movement through lurching time. each vertebra making its own decision about when to contract. when to release.

the body fragmenting into independent timekeepers. still connected by spine but no longer moving as one thing. salvation or schism. or both. or neither. the words don't fit the experience. like trying to count 16/11 with a base-ten mind.

## sixteen and eleven, or neither

some claim 16/11 isn't real. too complex for bodies. exists only on paper. in notation that looks like it's trying to escape the staff. you can write it but playing it breaks something in the wrists. in the inner ear. the body rejects it like foreign tissue. tries to convert it back to four. to three. to anything that divides clean.

but the snake had no investment in what counts as real meter. no wrists to break. no inner ear calibrated to western subdivisions. just ribs and vertebrae and muscles that contract in waves. moving through space that might be organized as 16/11 or might just be space.

<InlineShader id="shader-salvation" colors={[[0.4, 0.8, 0.8], [0.8, 0.3, 0.4], [0.3, 0.5, 0.9]]} width="40%" float="left" height="220px" />

the salvation, if it happened: finding that impossible patterns can be inhabited by giving up the parts of yourself that need patterns to be possible. shedding the skin that measures. that counts. that needs the downbeat to land somewhere predictable. becoming something that moves through 16/11 not by understanding it but by having a spine that can fragment its timing into enough independent sections that no single downbeat matters.

or someone saw a snake cross a path while practicing impossible meters and the two images fused. the brain doing what brains do. finding connections. making myths. calling it salvation because "snake moved while weird rhythm played nearby" doesn't carry enough weight.

patterns repeat until the repetition itself starts changing the pattern. bodies move until the movement rewrites what bodies are. sixteen over eleven lurches forward, creating gaps between beats wide enough for meaning to fall through. or for new meanings to grow. or for meaning to be revealed as optional. depending.

maybe salvation is discovering your spine has more joints than you thought. that each one can keep its own time. that moving forward doesn't require agreement between all your parts.

or maybe it's just a snake. just a meter that shouldn't work but does if you're built wrong enough. just another pattern eating its tail while the tail grows new segments that don't match the ones before.
