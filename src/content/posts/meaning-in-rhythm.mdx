# rhythm, or whatever it is

perhaps rhythm exists before melody. perhaps before harmony. perhaps before anything that could be called a note. or perhaps that's just another story told to make sense of vibration moving through space. the pulse might connect to something biological. or it might not. hard to say.

## what the body claims to know

hearts beat. lungs expand, contract. neurons fire in patterns that look rhythmic from certain angles. music's rhythm supposedly speaks directly because it mirrors something fundamental. when a drummer finds the pocket—assuming such a thing exists—bodies react before minds catch up. allegedly.

feet tap. heads nod. the movement happens. whether it means anything beyond the movement itself remains unclear.

## pattern, deviation, or both

rhythm might be meaningful because of repetition. or because of departure from repetition. or because of the space between the two. a 4/4 beat creates expectation, supposedly. meeting that expectation produces satisfaction. breaking it produces surprise.

jazz drummers ride cymbals for bars, then break the pattern. spines tingle. whether that's meaning or just nervous system response depends on who's defining terms.

## time organized differently, somewhere

different cultures organize time in ways that seem different from here. West African polyrhythms layer patterns that conflict and resolve. Indian classical music builds cycles that span measures before returning to something called sam. Afro-Cuban clave provides a framework. or several frameworks, depending.

these might be worldviews expressed in time. or they might be technical achievements that people later call worldviews. the distance between the two grows vague when observed from enough temporal remove.

## the space that might not be empty

someone once said it's not the notes played but the notes unplayed. applying that to rhythm seems obvious until examined closely. rests might be charged with potential. or they might just be absence. the space between beats could create tension, or it could simply be space.

reggae emphasizes the offbeat. the unplayed downbeat supposedly haunts the played offbeat. but hauntings require belief in ghosts.

silence participates in rhythm. meaning lives in implication. or meaning lives nowhere and implication is just pattern recognition gone mystical.

## finding, or not finding

stopping analysis to feel rhythm might access something direct. or it might just stop analysis. closing eyes at concerts lets drums guide movement. playing percussion on tables. walking to tempo. all of these happen.

whether rhythm contains meaning to be decoded or only experience to be had depends on whether decoding and experiencing are actually different activities. in the end—if ends exist—rhythm might remind biological systems that separation from time is an illusion.

or rhythm might just be vibration repeating until it stops. beat by beat, something moves forward. whether together or separately or not at all remains an open question.
