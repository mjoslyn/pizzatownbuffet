# membrane between states

allegedly, transformation happens at boundaries. where one thing becomes another. or where one thing stops pretending to be what it was. skin sheds. cells replace themselves every seven years, supposedly. by that math, nothing here now existed then. yet something persists through the replacement. or seems to.

<InlineShader id="shader-skin" colors={[[0.7, 0.3, 0.5], [0.4, 0.2, 0.6], [0.8, 0.5, 0.3]]} width="50%" float="right" height="240px" />

## what the serpent claims

snakes don't become different snakes when they shed. they just continue being snakes in newer configurations. the old skin left behind holds the shape of what passed through. evidence of transition, perhaps. or just debris.

the space between shedding and emerging—that narrow window where the membrane loosens but hasn't released—feels vulnerable, allegedly. eyes cloud over. movement becomes uncertain. something's ending while something else begins its approach.

whether this constitutes wisdom or just biological necessity depends on how much meaning gets assigned to pattern repetition.

## threshold mathematics

<InlineShader id="shader-threshold" colors={[[0.2, 0.5, 0.8], [0.6, 0.2, 0.7], [0.3, 0.7, 0.5]]} width="45%" float="left" height="220px" />

doorways separate rooms. or connect them. or both, depending on direction of travel. the threshold itself belongs to neither space. liminal zones supposedly carry charge. standing in doorways feels different than standing in rooms.

music builds transitions. the bridge that connects verse to chorus. the fermata that suspends time before release. the gear shift between movements. these moments might be the actual substance. or they might just be connective tissue that disappears under examination.

jazz musicians talk about "playing the changes"—navigating chord progressions that shift underneath sustained melodies. surfing transitions while they're happening. or drowning in them. hard to say from the outside.

## when division splits both ways

bifurcation creates two paths from one. or reveals that two paths existed all along, hidden in false unity. forked tongues taste air differently from each tip. whether that produces stereo perception or just confusion remains unclear.

<InlineShader id="shader-bifurcate" colors={[[0.5, 0.8, 0.3], [0.8, 0.2, 0.5], [0.3, 0.5, 0.9]]} width="40%" float="right" height="260px" />

cells divide to multiply. one becomes two. then four. then numbers that lose meaning. at each division, something copies itself while becoming something new. the membrane stretches, pinches, separates. identity disperses into plurality.

metamorphosis happens inside cocoons. what enters supposedly dissolves into soup before reorganizing into different architecture. the caterpillar might not survive the transition in any meaningful sense. the butterfly might be an entirely different consciousness wearing repurposed matter.

or maybe continuity persists through total dissolution. memory stored in pattern rather than substance.

## echo through skin

<InlineShader id="shader-echo" colors={[[0.9, 0.4, 0.2], [0.3, 0.6, 0.8], [0.6, 0.3, 0.7]]} width="48%" float="left" height="235px" />

sound travels through membranes differently than through air. bones conduct vibration. skin receives pressure waves. the eardrum translates atmospheric disturbance into mechanical motion into electrical signal into whatever "hearing" is.

every translation transforms the message. or corrupts it. or both. the original vibration and the final perception might share no actual substance. just echo through successive transformations.

drummers feel rhythm in their chest before their ears process it. bass frequencies move through bodies like weather. whether that's more authentic than auditory processing or just differently mediated remains an open question.

## becoming, or just continuing

the membrane between states might be the only state that exists. permanent transition. constant shedding without final form. every solid thing revealed as process masquerading as object.

or maybe states are real and membranes are just the friction between them. the necessary gap that allows difference to exist.

standing between, neither here nor there. supposedly uncomfortable. supposedly fertile. supposedly where all actual change happens.

or just where nothing is, stretching thin between two somethings.
