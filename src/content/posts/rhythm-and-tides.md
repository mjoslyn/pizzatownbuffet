# tides and rhythm, supposedly related

the ocean swells and recedes. twice a day, more or less. predictable, except when it isn't. never quite the same way twice, though the differences might be too small to matter or too large to measure, depending. something rhythmic happens. whether it speaks to anything beyond itself remains uncertain.

## the moon pulls, or so they say

tides respond to celestial movement. allegedly. the moon pulls, the earth spins, water rises and falls. twelve hours and twenty-five minutes to complete the cycle—not a clean division, which causes drift. like a syncopated beat against solar time, if such comparisons hold meaning.

perfectly quantized grids sound sterile to some ears. to other ears they sound precise. the slight push and pull that supposedly gives music breath might just be error. tides drift naturally between lunar and solar time, creating what could be called a phase shift or could be called nothing in particular.

## layered patterns, or chaos

tides might be polyrhythmic. the sun pulls, weaker than the moon but present. when sun and moon align, spring tides arrive—higher highs, lower lows. at right angles, neap tides dampen extremes. whether this resembles polyrhythms in music or just resembles pattern layering depends on how loosely resemblance gets defined.

West African drumming layers three against four against six. patterns conflict and resolve into something larger, supposedly. something that breathes, if breathing is the right metaphor. centuries of understanding, or centuries of doing without understanding. hard to separate the two from this distance.

## resonance, or amplification, or both

the tides shouldn't be dramatic. the moon's pull is weak. calculations predict tides of maybe a foot, based on gravitational force alone.

but tides reach fifty feet in certain bays. the explanation involves resonance. ocean basins having natural frequencies that amplify lunar pull. like opera singers shattering glass by hitting the right note—if that actually happens. coastline shape, water depth, bay size creating acoustic properties. turning subtle pull into dramatic rise and fall.

whether this works the same way music works depends on whether "the same way" has meaning across different contexts. guitar strings vibrate. hollow bodies amplify. voices resonate in cavities and rooms. the original vibration stays small. resonance makes it perceptible. or resonance is just another word for amplification wearing mystical clothing.

## invisible forces, maybe

what pulls on things. what creates rhythms in systems.

tides respond to forces at various distances—moon, sun, maybe jupiter if measurements get precise enough. invisible influences creating patterns that can be surfed or sailed through or ignored.

biological systems claim rhythms too. schedules, routines, choices. whether these are controlled or influenced or just happening remains unclear. seasons change. circadian rhythms cycle. some pulls register as obvious. others stay subtle until pattern recognition kicks in, which might happen or might not.

## the drift continues

tide comes in. tide goes out. never quite when expected, unless drift gets factored in. each day, high tide arrives fifty minutes later. yesterday's chart becomes useless.

whether rhythm in music works the same way depends on whether music has rhythms or just has vibrations organized by pattern-seeking minds. the feel supposedly has to come from the present moment. or the feel just comes from wherever feel comes from. structure can be planned. whether the living rhythm breathes or just continues moving stays open to interpretation.

the mystery, if there is one: mechanical processes producing something that feels alive. or mechanical processes just being mechanical while feeling projects aliveness onto them. tides keep moving. rhythm sections keep time. repetition and variation happening simultaneously.

whether the ocean remembers anything or bodies remember anything or meaning emerges from patterns depends entirely on what remembering is and whether emergence is real or just a convenient story told about complexity.
